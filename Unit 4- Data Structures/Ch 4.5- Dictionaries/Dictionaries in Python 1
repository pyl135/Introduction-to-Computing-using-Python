#We've defined a list of tuples below. Each tuple follows
#the format: (name, home state).
#
#Create a dictionary called taDict in the space below, where
#the keys are each TA's name, and the values are their home
#state.

taInfo = [("Joshua", "Georgia"),
          ("Jackie", "Vermont"),
          ("Marguerite", "Tennessee")]

#We've gone ahead and gotten you started here:
taDict = {"Joshua":"Georgia", "Jackie":"Vermont","Marguerite":"Tennessee"}

#Add your code to create the dictionary as described!
#The first item in each tuple should be a key, and
#the second item in each tuple should be its value.



#Now, create three variables: joshVal, jackVal, and
#margVal. Set joshVal equal to Josh's dictionary value,
#then jackVal equal to Jackie's, then margVal equal to
#Marguerite's. Remember how to properly access the value
#corresponding to a dictionary key!
joshVal = taDict["Joshua"]
jackVal = taDict["Jackie"]
margVal = taDict["Marguerite"]
