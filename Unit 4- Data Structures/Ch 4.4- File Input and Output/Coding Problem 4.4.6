#We've given you a file called "top500.txt" which contains
#the name and lifetime gross revenue of the top 500
#films at the time this question was written. 
#
#Each line of the given file is formatted like so:
# <name>\t<gross revenue in dollars>
#
#In other words, you should call .split("\t") to split
#the line into the movie name (the first item) and the
#gross (the second item).
#
#Unfortunately, these movies are not in order. Write a 
#function called "sort_films" that accepts two parameters:
#a string of a source filename and a string of a
#destination filename. Your function should open the
#source file and sort the contents from greatest gross
#revenue to least gross revenue, and write the sorted
#contents to the destination filename. You may assume the
#source file is correctly formatted.


#Write your function here!
